<h1>Twists</h1>

<blockquote> your hair is 90% of your selfie <cite> - Anonymous</cite></blockquote>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Twists are a really cute and simple way of keeping your hair out of your face
.</p>

<h2>Equipment</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 Rat-tail comb</li>
<li>1 hairbrush</li>
<li>Hair gel(optional)</li>
<li>Toothbrush(optional)</li>
<li>elastic bands(optional)</li>
<li>Silk/Satin pillowcase or headscarf(for protection while you sleep)</li>
</ul>

<h2> Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start off with clean dry hair.I highly recommend that you wash and deep condition your hair the night before you plan to braid your hair.</li>
<li> Using a Rat-tail comb divide your hair into 2 equal sections</li>
<li> Brush out any knots that may be in your hair</li>
<li>Take 2 sections of hair from the top your head and twist them with each other</li>
<li>Grab the surrounding hair and add to your main twist.Once you've reached the nape of your neck braid normally.</li>
<li>Secure the ends of your hair with an elastic band if necessary.</li>
<li>If you want you can slick down your babyhairs with a soft toothbrush and some styling gel.All you have to do is to apply gel to your edges and brush them in a swirling motion with a tooth brush.This creates a cute swirls of hair around your hairline instead of a bushy mess!If you don't have baby hairs then that's fine too </li>
<li>Alternatively you can leave your hair as is or make a sidefringe.I laid down my edges but sometimes I like to have two fringes to frame my face.</li>
<li>If you plan to sleep with the twists in your hair I reccomended that you sleep with a silk/satin pillowcase or headscarf while you sleep so as to prevent brakage from you tugging your hair in your sleep. </li>
</ol>
