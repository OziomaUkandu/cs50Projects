My name is Ozioma Ukandu and I created a children's memory game with Endy Ukandu.
This game was created using HTML and CSS for the core website layout and design.
JavaScript was used for the actual dynamic card game itself.

The aim of the game is as follows:

1.The child is presented with a grid of images.
2.The images have duplicates and are arranged randomly each time the child starts
a new game.
3.The child is able to look at the arrangement of the images for as long as they need
to complete the game.
4.Afterwards, the images are flipped over. The child must then try to match the
same images together from their memory
5.The game is won if the child completes the game within the set timer.

The game has 3 levels of difficulty; Easy, Medium and Hard. It is also divided into seperate themes which are fruit, animals
and EU flags to add more variety.
